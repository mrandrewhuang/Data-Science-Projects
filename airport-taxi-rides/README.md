# Project: Airport Taxi Rides (Time Series)

## Description

For this project, a taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, I was tasked to build a model to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. The RMSE metric was used to evaluate the model (and could not be greater than 48).

## Data Description

* The number of orders is in the `num_orders` column

## Tools

* Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodel
