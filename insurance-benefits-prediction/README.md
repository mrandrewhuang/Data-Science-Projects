# Project: Insurance Benefits Prediction (Linear Algebra)

## Description

For this project, an insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of machine learning. I was tasked with predicting whether a new customer would be likely to receive an insurance benefit.

I had to compare a trained prediction model vs. an untrained dummy model; predict the number of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model; apply data obfuscation to protect private customer data (without affecting the quality of the ML model/s).

## Data Description

* **Features**: insured person's gender, age, salary, and number of family members
* **Target**: number of insurance benefits received by an insured person over the last five years

## Tools

* Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn
