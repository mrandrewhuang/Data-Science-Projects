# Project: Video Game Sales Forecast

## Description

For this project, an online store selling video games globally wants the ability to spot best sellers in order to plan its advertising campaign for the following year.

I had to identify patterns that determined whether a game succeeded or not. The dataset included: user and expert reviews, genres, gaming platforms, and historical data on game sales, and I had to formulate and test hypotheses.
