# Project: Facial Age Verification (Computer Vision)

## Description

For this project, a supermarket chain wants to explore whether data science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they don't sell alcohol to people underage. My goal was to conduct EDA and then the evaluation via regression task using computer vision methods to determine the age of a person from a photograph.

## Data Description

_The dataset was obtained from [*ChaLearn Looking at People*](http://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/dataset/26/description/)._

* The `final_files` folder with 7.6k photos
* The `labels.csv` file with labels, with two columns: `file_name` and `real_age`

## Notes

* The program provided a Jupyter notebook template with hints and precode to help with the model
* Model training needed to be performed via the program's online platform as it had access to requisite GPU resources that I personally lacked
* The dataset is excluded here as it was too large to upload

## Tools

* Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Tensorflow/Keras
